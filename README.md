# OpenAI SonarQube Action

Loosly based on https://github.com/odegay/sonar-gpt-fixes - the idea is to take suggestions from sonarqube code analysis and use generative model to fix the code. While the result might not be 100% accurate, it can save developers time by switching their role from "implementor" to "reviewer". This action allows fine-tuning to skip some suggestions and produce cleaner results.
